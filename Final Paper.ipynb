    "The Academy Awards –popularly known as The Oscars– capture the attention of media all over the world every year. In recent ceremonies a growing debate has been set on the lack of representation of women and people of color in the awards, with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite flooding social media. This paper aims to analyze the gender and racial diversity in the film industry in the United States through an analysis of the awards. The first part of the project focuses on the demographics of the nominees and winners throughout history, while a second part looks at the dialogues of the films nominated for *Best Picture* in the years 1989, 2015 and 2017.

As for people of color, in 2020 they received 11% of nominations, meanwhile they add up to 40% of the US population. If we look at the past decade, woman received 35% of nominations and POC 12%."
